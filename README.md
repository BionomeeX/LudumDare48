## Game made for the Ludum Dare 48, theme: Deeper and Deeper

You know, sometimes life is like a butterfly, short.

So well, this gamejam we had a lot of ambitions, maybe too many\
We did lot of things, but most of our coding stuffs is hidden behind bugs and unfinished features\
We however have a lot of cool sprites, models and audio, so don't forget to check our in-game gallery too!

Sadly we also got runtime error on WebGL so our game will only be available on Windows

Well at the end our game may not be like as we wished but we learned a lot from this experience and we had a lot of fun too\
Even if our final product may not be that interesting, we hope you'll still see all the efforts we spent into it!
